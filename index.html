                <h2>Biography</h2>

                <p>Massimo Daul was born in Milan, Italy, and has spent much of his life moving between the east coast of the United States and Europe. After attending UWC Adriatic for two years, he moved to New York City, where he has been studying Mathematics and Computer Science at New York University (NYU) for the past three years.

His research focuses on low-resource machine learning, particularly in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and speech processing. Massimo is passionate about developing computational tools to help preserve endangered languages, making linguistic resources more accessible. His work spans speaker diarization, forced alignment, and optimization techniques, with a special interest in applying linear algebra and probabilistic methods to solve discrete alignment problems. He has several published papers, with more currently under review.

Beyond research, Massimo enjoys working on machine learning projects, including:

Learnability of linguistically-informed tokenization methods

Approaching Zero-shot ASR using phone class prediction

End-to-end forced alignment and ASR pipelines for low-resource corpora

When heâ€™s not immersed in research, Massimo plays soccer, piano, and drums. He recently released an EP with the Third Street Band (ðŸŽµ (<a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/6HSnF8Ca1kHwr56Acu7stT?si=7jLG4An9Qhyr7teYkxVO0Q" target="_blank" style="display: inline;">Listen Here</a>) ðŸŽµ) and has a deep love for cooking and baking. He also enjoys spending time outdoors, playing hide and seek, and whistlingâ€”sometimes all at once.

Looking ahead, Massimo plans to return to Trieste to pursue a master's degree in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science at the University of Trieste (UNITS). He hopes to improve fine-tuning techniques for ASR, score plenty of goals, and, most importantly, keep eating great food.</p>
